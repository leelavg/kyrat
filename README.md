Description
===========
kyrat is a ssh wrapper that allows to source local dotfiles
on a ssh session to a remote host. It works either from/to a Linux or OSX machine.

*kyrat* transfers the content of a **bash** user-defined module
(located in either `~/.config/kyrat/bashrc` or in the directory `~/.config/kyrat/bashrc.d/`)
to the remote host and open a bash session by sourcing the transferred modules.

Similarly, *kyrat* can transfer **inputrc** files (located
in either `~/.config/kyrat/inputrc` or
inside the directory `~/.config/kyrat/inputrc.d/`)
and **vimrc** files (located in either `~/.config/kyrat/vimrc` or inside
the directory `~/.config/kyrat/vimrc.d/`).

Quickstart
==========
### Bash ###
Write locally in either `~/.config/kyrat/bashrc` or any files inside `~/.config/kyrat/bashrc.d/`:

    alias q=exit

    function processof(){
        ps -U $1 -u $1 u
    }

    export PATH=$PATH:/sbin:/usr/sbin


Now, just access to your remote host:

    $> kyrat myuser@myserver.com
    myserver.com $> processof feel
        feel     20567  0.3  0.0  14748   952 pts/5    S+   12:44   0:13 ping www.google.com
        feel     23458  0.0  0.0  12872  1372 pts/9    R+   13:49   0:00 ps -U feel -u feel u

    myserver.com $> q
    exit

Or even inline:

    $> kyrat myuser@myserver.com -- processorof feel

### Vim ###
Write locally in either `~/.config/kyrat/vimrc` or any files inside `~/.config/kyrat/vimrc.d/`:

    nnoremap <silent> <Leader>e :Explore<CR>

Now, just access to your remote host via `kyrat`, run vim and you will have the shortcut `\e` for running the vim file explorer.

### Inputrc ###
Write locally in either `~/.config/kyrat/inputrc` or any files inside `~/.config/kyrat/inputrc.d/`:

    set completion-ignore-case On

Now, just access to your remote host via `kyrat` and the terminal will have case insensitive tab completion.

### Tmux ###
Write locally in either `~/.config/kyrat/tmux.conf` or any files inside `~/.config/kyrat/tmux.conf.d/`:

    bind e setw synchronize-panes on \; display "Synchronization ON"
    bind E setw synchronize-panes off \; display "Synchronization OFF"

Now, just access to your remote host via `kyrat` and run the following:

```bash
tmux -f "$TMUX_CONF"
```

This will open a tmux session and you can now toggle synchronization between
panes on the same window with the keys `e/E`.

Comparison with sshrc
=====================
[sshrc](https://github.com/Russell91/sshrc) is a program that performs a similar task as Kyrat.
Despite its popularity, at the time of writing, there are significant drawbacks on using sshrc.

The following table shows the comparison between Kyrat and sshrc:

|  | Dotfile types supported | Platform  | Unit tests | Integration tests | Compression | Portability | Default remote shells | Automatic removal of the remote dotfiles | Remote dotfiles location |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Kyrat** | `bash`, `vim`, `inputrc` | Linux, OSX | **YES** | **YES** | **YES** | Small number of `coreutils` executables required | **ANY** | **YES** | `/tmp` and fallback to `$HOME` |
| **sshrc** | `bash` (the rest requires additional work) | Unknown | **NO** | **NO** | **YES** | Big number of executables required (`tar`, `awk`, `openssl`, and more) | `bash` only | **YES** | `/tmp` only |

Installation
